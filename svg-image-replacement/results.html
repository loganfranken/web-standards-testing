  <h1>Using Image Replacement with Icon Fonts Results</h1>

  <a href="index.html">View Tests</a>

  <p>
    The following platforms were tested:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Firefox 41, Chrome 45, and Internet Explorer 11 with NVDA 2015.3 on Windows 7</li>
    <li>Firefox 41, Chrome 45, and Internet Explorer 11 with JAWS 16.0.4350 on Windows 7</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    On all platforms, the results were the same: "Website Logo" was always
    read. In cases where an <code>img</code> element was embedded directly,
    the word "Graphic" was read before "Website Logo."

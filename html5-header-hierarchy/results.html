  <h1>HTML5 Header Hierarchy Tests</h1>

  <a href="index.html">View Tests</a>

  <p>
    The following platforms were tested:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Firefox 41, Chrome 46, and Internet Explorer 11 with NVDA 2015.3 on Windows 7</li>
    <li>Firefox 41, Chrome 46, and Internet Explorer 11 with JAWS 16.0.4350 on Windows 7</li>
  </ul>

  <!--
  <p>
    On all platforms, the results were the same: "Menu" is always read,
    except for the "Standard Font Icon" case, where the text isn't present.
  </p>

# Web Standards Testing

This repository contains a number of web standards-related tests and their
results.

## Tests

### Title as Label

A variety of tests to see whether or not the `title` or `aria-label`
attributes are sufficient replacements for a `label` in cases where the
`label` is redundant.

* [Discussion](https://github.com/ucsb-wsg/ucsb-wsg.github.io/issues/30)
* [Tests](title-as-label/index.html)
* [Results](title-as-label/results.html)

icon fonts.

* [Discussion](https://github.com/ucsb-wsg/ucsb-wsg.github.io/issues/31)
* [Tests](icon-font-replacement/index.html)
* [Results](icon-font-replacement/results.html)
